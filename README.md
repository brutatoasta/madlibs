# Madlibs Game

This project started off with a desire to make word substitutions to a multiline string in Python, in a way that's easily human-readable.

That component did not make it into a Madlibs game, but I made one anyway.

The thought process is shown in this [Jupyter Notebook](/madlibs.ipynb).

Play it locally by running `madlibs.py`.
